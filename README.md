**Financial Document Analysis with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**

---

**Overview:**

This project focuses on developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to analyze 10-Q financial statements using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to generate answers to questions about financial documents without fine-tuning the Large Language Model (LLM) by integrating Langchain and ChromaDB for document indexing and retrieval.

---

**Project Components:**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - The `sec-edgar-downloader` Python package is used to download 10-Q financial statements from the SEC website.

2. **Preprocessing and Indexing:**
   - Utilize Langchain and ChromaDB to preprocess financial documents and create a vector database for indexing and retrieval of relevant documents.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System:**
   - Implement a RAG system using Llama 2.0 from Meta to interrogate financial documents and generate answers to user queries.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize insights from the generated answers using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to provide intuitive representations of key information extracted from financial documents.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-document-analysis.git
   cd financial-document-analysis
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and setup Langchain and ChromaDB according to their respective documentation.

---

**Usage:**

1. Run the data ingestion script to download 10-Q financial statements.
   ```
   python data_ingestion.py
   ```

2. Preprocess and index the financial documents using Langchain and ChromaDB.
   ```
   # Add instructions for preprocessing and indexing
   ```

3. Start the RAG system to generate answers to user queries.
   ```
   # Add instructions for running the RAG system
   ```

4. Visualize insights from the generated answers.
   ```
   # Add instructions for visualization
   ```
